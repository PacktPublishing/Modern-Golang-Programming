This is the code repository for [Mastering Golang Programming [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-golang-programming-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786468239), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient applications. This course will be your one stop guide to master the core concepts of Go programming.You will begin by getting an overview of the language before organizing the Go workflows. You will then understand the concepts of OOP with Golang and will learn to use interfaces in Golang. From here, you will be introduced to Functional and Reactive programming with Go. You will then learn to work with the web and will learn microservices in Go. Going forward, you will learn about topics such as Concurrency, parallelism, and Error Handling. From here, you will learn how to evaluate performance with profiling, extracting the best performance from your Go programs without sacrificing readability, and attacking the bottlenecks of your program. Youâ€™ll understand vendoring, reproducible builds, reflection, and will learn how to access C functions with a simple Go call. Then, you will be introduced to design patterns and techniques with Golang, good coding practices, and will learn to write idiomatic Go code. Finally, you will learn to test and debug your application.By the end of the video, you will be adept with the knowledge to build robust and scalable applications with Go.
